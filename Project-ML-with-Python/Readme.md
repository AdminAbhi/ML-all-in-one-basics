# Battle of best classifier

### Introduction
This project is about finding the best classifier which can predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. 
With a historical dataset from previous loan applications, we will clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. 

#### We will be using the following algorithms to build our models:
- k-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

### **Project Flow :**
1. Import required libraries
2. Download the dataset
3. Data visualization
4. Data Pre-processing
5. Feature selection and Label Encoding
6. Data Normalization
7. Train-Test Split
8. Classification using Different Algorithms
9. Model Evaluation using Test set
10. Test Data Pre-processing pipeline
11. Calculating Accuracies of All Models

#### The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:
- Jaccard index
- F1-score

#### Follow the Notebook link below for description and results in detail:
